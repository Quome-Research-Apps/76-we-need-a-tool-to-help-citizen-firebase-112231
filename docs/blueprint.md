## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) for reliability and trustworthiness, reflecting the civic context. Note: The user specifically requested this color, Teal.
- Background color: Very light green (#E0EEE0), a desaturated variant of the teal primary, for a calm, neutral background.
- Accent color: Pale Yellow (#FAFAD2), an analogous color to the teal that is different enough to provide good contrast without being jarring.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for both headings and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, clear icons representing different request types (e.g., trash, streets, lights) for quick identification.
- Maintain a clean, list-based layout for easy scanning. Use visual hierarchy (e.g., bolding, spacing) to highlight important information like dates and statuses.
- Use subtle transitions (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) when updating or displaying requests to provide a polished user experience.
